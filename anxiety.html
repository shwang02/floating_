You go closer, only to find that they are actually meteors shooting across. Each burning, each gaining speed. Your curiousity overtakes you, and you land on top of one of the meteors.</em></p><p class="align-left"><em>The meteor is burning, it overwhelms you. There's too many around you. All burning up, all gaining speed. You jump off, hoping there aren't more. But it doesn't stop. It just keeps going, shaking up your body.</em></p><hr><h2 class="align-center">Anxiety</h2><p>Anxiety is very common to experience, and it comes with overwhelming thoughts. Anxiety comes in many different forms, which include social anxiety, panic, phobias, etc. </p><p>Anxiety is normal. It is something we all experience that goes hand-in-hand with our stress. Just as stress in moderate levels is fine, anxiety in moderate levels is fine. It is what keeps us anticipating and prepared. Of course, too much of it is not good for our bodies, which can overwhelm us and feel like too much.</p><h3 class="align-center">Common Symtoms</h3><p>According to the World Health Organization, common symptoms are:</p><table style="border: 2px solid #0E1326; padding: 10px;" border="1"><tbody><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 100%; height: 50.3594px;">trouble concentrating/making decisions</td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 100%; height: 50.3594px;">feeling irritable, tense, or restless</td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 100%; height: 50.3594px;">experiencing nausea or abdominal distress</td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 100%; height: 50.3594px;">having heart palpitations</td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 100%; height: 50.3594px;"><p>sweating, trembling, shaking</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100%;"><p>trouble sleeping</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100%;"><p>sense of impending danger or panic</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>*It is extremely important to not self-diagnose yourself. It is popular for social media posts to engage their audience by asking if you "relate to these symptoms" and diagnose you with a certain condition. Those that are not clinically anxious can also experience similar symptoms, like trouble making decisions.  In order to confirm, make sure to reach out to a professional.*</em></p><h2 class="align-center">Statistics</h2><p>Data from the American College Health Association (ACHA) shows that 35% of college students noted being diagnosed with anxiety in 2022, with 77% reaching out to healthcare professionals.</p><p>A major factor that contributed to this statistic was COVID, which began in 2020 and is ongoing today. Having to be isolated for so long without social support has taken a toll on mental health, especially among young adults. In addition, the constant stress of feeling the need to predict the future as college students is a major factor, as college students feel the need to figure their life out by the time they graduate. It is important to remember that it is okay to be behind, and we shouldn't expect ourselves to make such important decisions. Our brains do not fully develop until we are 25 years old, so as college students it's okay to make mistakes and not know what we are doing.</p><h2 class="align-center">Common Strategies to Cope</h2><p>whats good homie lomie bajomie. breathe in breathe out is a good method. take a break and let the breeze do its job.</p><table style="border: 2px solid #0e1326; padding: 10px; width: 100%; height: 303.156px;" border="1"><tbody><tr style="height: 50.8594px;"><td style="width: 99.8575%; height: 50.8594px;">Self Care (exercise, eat healthy, go outside)</td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 99.8575%; height: 50.3594px;"><a href="https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/breathing-exercises-for-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breathing Exercises (click to see methods)</a></td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 99.8575%; height: 50.3594px;">Reach out to loved ones and share your thoughts</td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 99.8575%; height: 50.3594px;">Ground yourself in what's real and what's possible</td></tr><tr style="height: 50.3594px;"><td style="width: 99.8575%; height: 50.3594px;">Reach out to a healthcare professional if it's too much</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p><em>After a few minutes, there is finally an end to this storm of shooting "stars."
