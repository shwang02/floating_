It is a part of our daily lives and what can act as a motivating factor to keep us going. Smaller levels of stress are what allow us to stay focused and feel the need to reach our goals.</p>\n<p>Excessive amounts of stress, however, is what can cause a strain on our bodies. Being exposed to too much stress will lead to mental, physical, emotional breakdowns which can lead to burn out.
