The shooting so-called stars that overwhelmed you, the burnt-out star, or the sucking black hole. All felt too familiar. <br><br>Everyone feels like they're floating at a certain point in their lives. Everyone feels lost at a certain point, not sure where they stand in life. Time just seems to fly, people seeming to run while you're walking. Comparing yourself to others is what you can't help to do, wondering why you're behind while they're all so ahead. Feeling like you've been in the dark for too long, like you can't feel that fire in you no longer.</p>\n<p>People may feel burnt out, worn out from all the stress that life has to offer. People may feel extremely anxious, constantly worried about the future and what to make of it. People may have prolonged sadness, feeling like they entered a deep hole that they can never get out of. </p>\n<p>There's always a place you can land, though. A place where you can feel like you can get back up on your feet and feel safe. A place you can call home, whether it is a physical place, imagined place, or people. There is always a way out no matter where you are in life. As long as you keep on going, even if it feels like you're floating nowhere, you'll reach the ground someday. And you'll come back stronger, fired up, ready to face life once again.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://shwang02.github.io/floating_/welcome-d.html\" class=\"button\">Home</a>  <a href=\"https://shwang02.github.io/floating_/about.html\" class=\"button\">About the Project</a></p>",

It is a part of our daily lives and what can act as a motivating factor to keep us going. Smaller levels of stress are what allow us to stay focused and feel the need to reach our goals.</p>\n<p>Excessive amounts of stress, however, is what can cause a strain on our bodies. Being exposed to too much stress will lead to mental, physical, emotional breakdowns which can lead to burn out.
