<p>Have you ever felt like you were floating in time and space, outside of the confines of reality? As if time was constantly chasing you, but you were floating slowly while everyone would pass by you? The only thing you hear is the sound of the clock, but you don't even know what day it is, what time it is, what you're even supposed to be doing. You're just there... existing. Wondering. But something just keeps on bothering you. Anxiety keeps hitting you.</p>
