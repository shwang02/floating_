                <p><em>Welcome to the Supernova, or more, "the Burnt Out Star." The supernova occurs when a star is dying, with it's fire inside fading and dimming as time passes until it will explode. As you float close to the star, you notice your body feeling heavier. You connect with the star.</em></p>

<h2 class="align-center">Burnout</h2>
<p>The feeling of burnout is a common feeling amongst all of us, especially as students. Often times we wonder, "How did I become like this? I was so strongheaded and organized not too long ago, what's wrong with me?" It occurs after a prolonged amount of stress that gets to the point of interfering with our ability to do daily tasks.</p>
<h2 class="align-center">Common signs of Burnout are:</h2>
<p>As per Malvern Behavioral Health, Jerry Kosmin refers to these signs of burnout:</p>

<td style="width: 50.0713%; height: 165.547px;">After prolonged stress and overdoing yourself, your body will start to wear out and tell you it needs a break. Not taking a break and pushing yourself will wear you out even further.</td>

<p>With increased stress is a higher toll on your body, leading to high cortisol (stress hormone) levels, high blood pressure, and ultimately fatigue. Most common factors that contribute to such stress in students is comparing ourselves to other people, immense workloads, neverending deadlines, and feelings of loneliness.  Anxiety is all over your mind, you feel susceptible to be depressed. You can't help but wonder if you're even doing the right thing.</p>
<p class="msg--info">Did you know loneliness is as deadly as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?</p>
<h2 class="align-center">There is such a thing as "good stress" and "bad stress"</h2>

<figcaption >Lower amounts of stress have better effects compared to high amounts of stress.</figcaption>

<p>Stress in itself is not a bad thing. It is a part of our daily lives and what can act as a motivating factor to keep us going. Smaller levels of stress are what allow us to stay focused and feel the need to reach our goals.</p>
<p>Excessive amounts of stress, however, is what can cause a strain on our bodies. Being exposed to too much stress will lead to mental, physical, emotional breakdowns which can lead to burn out. So don't be afraid to experience stress, but don't let stress overtake your entire life.</p>
